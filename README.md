## About The Project

This landing page is designed as a direct upsell for users who have just completed the "Values Finder Quiz." [cite_start]It addresses the common gap between knowing one's values and actively living by them[cite: 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]. [cite_start]The page introduces the Training Series as a structured, year-long system to help users integrate their values, build momentum, and achieve lasting fulfillment[cite: 88, 97].

### Key Features of the Page:

- [cite_start]**Personalized Hook:** The page immediately engages the user by displaying their #1 Power Value from the quiz they just completed[cite: 68, 74].
- [cite_start]**Problem Agitation:** It uses the effective analogy of a "gym membership you never use" to highlight the importance of practice over mere awareness[cite: 85, 86, 87].
- [cite_start]**Detailed Program Offer:** It clearly outlines what's included in the 52-week program, such as weekly action forms, AI coach feedback, and quick-start tools[cite: 101, 103, 104, 107].
- [cite_start]**Tiered Pricing Model:** The page presents three clear subscription tiers—Clarity, Momentum, and Breakthrough—allowing users to choose the level of support that best fits their goals[cite: 115, 116].
- [cite_start]**Unique Selling Proposition:** It differentiates the program by highlighting the advanced Coaching AI, which is built on the extensive Robbins-Madanes Training library of over 200+ sources[cite: 126, 127, 130, 134].
